[`K.sh`](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot) is a very low latency [market making](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md#what-is-market-making) trading bot with a fully featured [web interface](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui). The bot can place and cancel orders on one of [several supported cryptocoin exchanges](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#compatible-exchanges) in less than a few miliseconds per order on a decent machine.

Runs on unix-like systems. A built-in server-less SQLite database persists data through a C++ interface. The bot can be installed with Docker, but manual installation in a dedicated [Debian](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/)/[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), [CentOS](https://wiki.centos.org/Download) or macOS instance is recommended.

![Web UI Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/master/etc/img/web_ui_preview.png)

The web UI is compatible with most web browsers/devices/resolutions, but Firefox or Chrome at 1600px are recommended. Doesn't require configuration of any web server (unless installed behind your own reverse proxy).

### Docker Installation

See [etc/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#dockerfile) section if you use winy (because the Manual Installation only works on unix-like platforms).

### Manual GIT Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `git`, `make` and `vim` installed.

2. Install it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K):
```
 $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot K
 $ cd K
 $ make install
```

3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime see [Upgrade to the latest commit](#upgrade-to-the-latest-commit) section.

### Manual ZIP Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `curl`, `make` and `vim` installed.

2. Install it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K):
```
 $ mkdir K
 $ cd K
 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/master/Makefile > Makefile
 $ make install
```

3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime just run `make reinstall`.

### After Manual Installation

See [configuration](#configuration) section while setting up the configuration options in your new config file `K.sh`.

Once the config file is ready, you can start the bot:
```
 $ ./K.sh
```

Alternatively use `make start` to run `K.sh` in the background using [screen](https://www.decf.berkeley.edu/help/unix/screen.html) (to see the output, attach the screen with `make screen` [or run all at once with `make start screen`]).

Feel free to run `make stop` or `make restart` anytime, and don't forget to [read the fucking manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

Troubleshooting:

 * If there is no wallet data on a given exchange, do a manual buy/sell order first using the website of the exchange.

 Optional:

 * See `./K.sh --help` and `make help`.

 * Replace the certificate at `etc/sslcert` folder with your own, see [web ui](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui) section. But, the certificate provided is a fully featured default openssl, that you may just need to authorise in your browser.

### Configuration

See [etc/K.sh.dist](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/etc/K.sh.dist) file or your own `./K.sh` file.

It just contains a few variables with examples ready to be reused (the suggested urls will work). The very end of the file contains the code that starts the bot.

### Upgrade to the latest commit

After reinstalling, you will need to manually restart any running instances using `make restart` or `make restartall`.

To upgrade under Manual ZIP Installation, please run `make reinstall`.

To upgrade under Manual GIT Installation:

Feel free anytime to check if there are new modifications with `make diff`.

Once you decide that is time to upgrade, execute `make latest` to download and install the latest modifications in your remote branch (or directly `make reinstall` to skip the validation of the new commit messages).

If you only use `git` to pull the latest commits, you will still need to recompile using `make reinstall` (or using `make dist K bundle` if you have modified source files) and then `make restart` to start using the latest version.

### Multiple instances party time

Please note, an "instance" is in fact a `*.sh` config file located in the top level path; using a single machine and the same source folder, you can run as many instances as `*.sh` files you have in the top level path (limited by the available free RAM).

You can list the current running instances with `make list`.

If you haven't defined a config file, `make start`, `make screen`, `make stop` and `make restart` will use the default config file `K.sh`.

To run multiple instances using a collection of config files:

1. Create a new config file with `cp etc/K.sh.dist X.sh && chmod +x X.sh` (use `X.sh` or any name but keep `.sh` extension).

2. Edit the new config file `vim X.sh`

3. Run the new instance with `./X.sh` or to run in the background, use `K=X.sh make start`. To attach to the new instance's screen, use `K=X.sh make screen`. To stop the new instance, use `K=X.sh make stop` and to restart it, use `K=X.sh make restart`. The environment variable `K` specifies the filename of the config file that you want to use.

4. Open in the web browser the different pages of the ports of the different running instances, or display the UI of all instances together in a single page using the MATRYOSHKA link in the footer (that can be predefined using the optional argument `--matryoshka=URL`).

After multiple config files are setup, to control them all together instead of one by one, the commands `make startall`, `make stopall` and `make restartall` are also available, just remember that config files with a filename starting with underscore symbol "_" will be skipped.

### Application Usage

1. Open your web browser to connect to HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine running K. If you're running K locally on Mac/Windows on Docker, replace "localhost" with the address returned by `boot2docker ip`.

2. Read up on how to use K and market making in the [manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

3. Use the web UI to change the quoting parameters. Click the "BTC/USD" button to start making markets. Click it again to stop. When the button is green, the bot is actively placing orders.

### Web UI

Once `K` is up and running, visit HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) to access the UI (i.e. [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)). There are inputs for quoting parameters, grids to display market orders, market trades, your trades, your order history, your positions, and a big button with the currency pair you are trading. When you're ready, click that button green to begin sending out quotes. The UI uses a healthy mixture of socket.io and angularjs observed with reactivexjs.

If you want to generate your own certificate see [SSL for internal usage](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).

In case you really want to use plain HTTP, use `--without-ssl` argument.

### Databases

Each currency pair of each exchange will use a different sqlite database file.

All database files are located at `/data/db/K.*.db`, where `*` is the identifier with format `exchange.base_currency.quote_currency`; it is located outside the application path to survive reinstalls and wild `rm -rf path/to/K`.

You can copy any `.db` file to another machine when migrating or as a backup.

If a database file does not exist, the application will create it on boot; otherwise, it will use the existing one.

To explore each database file you can use https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser or a similar tool.

To set a different database path or to set an [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), use `--database=PATH` argument (see `--help`).

Even if using an in-memory database, the quoting parameters are always loaded from and saved into the disk file database.

### Charts

The metrics are not saved anywhere, it is just UI data collected with a visibility retention of `n` hours (where `n` is the value of `profit` quoting parameter), to display over time:

 * Market Fair Value with High and Low Prices
 * Trades Complete
 * Target Position for BTC currency (TBP)
 * Target Position for Fiat currency
 * STDEV and EWMA values for Quote Protection and APR
 * Amount available in wallet for buy
 * Amount held in open trades for buy
 * Amount available in wallet for sell
 * Amount held in open trades for sell
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in BTC currency
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in Fiat currency

### Cloud Hosting

If you ask me, [<img height="20px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/29756933-3e64c62e-8ba8-11e7-916a-3b0ae1481a52.png">](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?475987/cloud/) is a very nice web hosting company (awesome support team, awesome servers). Feel free to use this referral link to get a discount subtracted from my referral earnings (i'm a user since 2008).

### XMR miner

Because testing requires coins (or patience), the UI includes a XMR miner to generate coins, but it is disabled by default.

Once enabled, the UI (and only the UI, which lives in your own web browser) will start mining XMR coins; the server will not  be used to mine (so cpu trading cycles of the server are not affected when you enable this).

Is there because I use it, but you can run it too if you decide to collaborate with the development of both XMR and K.

On the server side, there is a seperate XMR miner that is disabled by default (see `--free-version` argument at [Trading for Fun](#trading-for-fun) section).

### Test units and Build notes

Make sure your build machine has [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed, and also ensure `make dist` provides all dependencies without errors.

Then, feel free to run `make test` anytime.

To rebuild the application with your modifications, see `make help` and choose a target.

To pipe the output to stdout, execute the application in the foreground with `./K.sh --naked`.

To ignore the output, execute the application in the background with `screen -dmS K K.sh` or with the alias `make start` or simply `./K.sh`.

### Release 1.0 Changelog:

see the upstream project [michaelgrosner/tribeca](https://github.com/michaelgrosner/tribeca).

### Unlock

The bot is unlocked for collaborators and contributors (feel free to make acceptable Pull Requests for already opened issues or for anything you consider useful, and let me know the BTC Payment Address for the bot that you wish to unlock in the description of the PR, and I will credit it for you).

While locked, you are limited to using the first 3 market levels; once unlocked the bot reads the full list (up to thousands) of market levels from the exchange.

Anonymous users can also unlock any API Key by paying 0.01210000 BTC to the address displayed in the UI of the bot. Once unlocked you may use different currency pairs or reinstall on a different machine with the same unlocked API Key. However, if you want to use more than one exchange, you will need to pay again to unlock the API Key for each exchange.

Otherwise if you choose to not support further development by ctubio, just keep running some old commit and do not upgrade (any commit prior to v3.0 was completely unlocked).

### Trading for Fun

Use `--free-version` argument to anonymously unlock any API Key and avoid the payment.

All market levels will be visible and usable but not in realtime, instead will be slowdown around 4 seconds with a [XMR mining calculation](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/crypto/hash.c#L42) of 21 hashes.

If any hash meets the current XMR network target, it will be send to my XMR pool for my fun and profit.

`--free-version` effectively slows down fun and profit for you and me. Please don't open issues asking how much % less the bot generates with `--free-version`; it is relative to your trading strategy, the market conditions, and the bot's performance. It is almost impossible to know.

### Donations

nope, this project doesn't have maintenance costs. but you can donate to your favorite developer today! (or tomorrow!)

or see the upstream project [michaelgrosner/tribeca](https://github.com/michaelgrosner/tribeca).

or donate your time with programming or financial suggestions in the topical IRC channel [##tradingBot](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.domirc.net:6697/?theme=cli##tradingBot) at irc.domirc.net on port 6697 (SSL), or 6667 (plain) or feel free to make any question, but questions technically are not donations.
