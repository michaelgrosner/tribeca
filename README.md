[`K.sh`](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot) is a very low latency [market making](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md#what-is-market-making) trading bot with a full featured [web interface](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui), it directly connects to [several cryptocoin exchanges](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#configuration-options). On a decent machine reacts to market data by placing and canceling orders in under milliseconds.

### Docker Installation

See [etc/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#dockerfile) section if you use winy (because the Manual Installation only works on unix-like platforms).

### Manual Installation
1. Ensure your target machine has installed `git`, `vim`, `make` and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

2. Run in any location that you wish (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K):
```
 $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot K
 $ cd K
 $ make install
 $ vim K.sh
```

See [configuration](#configuration) section while setting up the configuration options in your new config file `K.sh`.

Once the config file is ready, execute `./K.sh`.

Or `make start` to run `K.sh` in the background using [screen](https://www.decf.berkeley.edu/help/unix/screen.html); to see the output, attach the screen with `make screen`.

Feel free to run `make stop` or `make restart` anytime, and don't forget to [read the fucking manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

Troubleshooting:

 * Create a temporary [swap file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17173972/how-do-you-add-swap-to-an-ec2-instance) (after install you can swapoff) if the installation fails with error: `virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory`.

 * If there is no wallet data on a given exchange, do a manual buy/sell order first using the website of the exchange.

 Optional:

 * See `./K.sh --help` and `make help`.

 * Replace the certificate at `etc/sslcert` folder with your own, see [web ui](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui) section. But, the certificate provided is a fully featured default openssl, that you may just need to authorise in your browser.

### Configuration

See [etc/K.sh.dist](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/etc/K.sh.dist) file or your own `./K.sh` file.

It just contains a few variables with examples ready to be reused (the suggested urls will work), and at the very end of the file is the execution of the bot.

### Upgrade to the latest commit

Feel free anytime to check if there are new modifications with `make diff`.

Once you decide that is time to upgrade, execute `make latest` to download and install the latest modifications in your remote branch (or directly `make reinstall` to skip the display of the new commit messages).

After install the latest version, all running instances will be restarted.

### Multiple instances party time

Please note, an "instance" is in fact a `*.sh` config file located in the top level path; using a single machine and the same source folder, you can run as many instances as `*.sh` files you have in the top level path (limited by the available free RAM).

Anytime you can list the current instances running with `make list`.

Simple commands like `make start`, `make screen`, `make stop` or `make restart` (without any config file defined) will use the default config file `K.sh`.

To run multiple instances using a collection of config files:

1. Create a new config file with `cp etc/K.sh.dist X.sh && chmod +x X.sh` (use `X.sh` or any name but keep `.sh` extension).

2. Edit the new config file as you alternatively desire.

3. Run the new instance with `./X.sh` or `K=X.sh make start`, also the commands `make screen`, `make stop` and `make restart` allow the environment variable `K`, the value is simply the filename of the config file that you want to run; this value will also be used as the `uid` of the process executed by `screen`.

4. Open in the web browser the different pages of the ports of the different running instances, or display the UI of all instances together in a single page using the MATRYOSHKA link in the footer and the optional argument `--matryoshka=URL`.

After multiple config files are setup, to control them all together instead of one by one, the commands `make startall`, `make stopall` and `make restartall` are also available, just remember that config files with a filename starting with underscore symbol "_" will be skipped.

### Application Usage

1. Open your web browser to connect to HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine running K. If you're running K locally on Mac/Windows on Docker, replace "localhost" with the address returned by `boot2docker ip`.

2. Read up on how to use K and market making in the [manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

3. Set up trading parameters to your liking in the web UI. Click the "BTC/USD" button so it is green to start making markets.

### Web UI

Once `K` is up and running, visit HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine on which it is running to view the admin view. There are inputs for quoting parameters, grids to display market orders, market trades, your trades, your order history, your positions, and a big button with the currency pair you are trading. When you're ready, click that button green to begin sending out quotes. The UI uses a healthy mixture of socket.io and angularjs observed with reactivexjs.

If you want to generate your own certificate see [SSL for internal usage](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).

In case you really want to use plain HTTP, remove the files `server.crt` and `server.key` inside `etc/sslcert` folder.

### Databases

Each currency pair of each exchange will use a different sqlite database file.

All database files are located at `/data/db/K.*.db`, where `*` is the identifier with format `exchange.base_currency.quote_currency`; it is located outside the application path to survive reinstalls and wild `rm -rf path/to/K`.

You can copy any `.db` file to another machine when migrating or as a backup.

If a database file do not exists, the application will create it on boot; otherwise, it will load it and reuse it.

To see the data of each database file you can use https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser or similars.

To set a different database path or to set an [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), use `--database=PATH` argument (see `--help`).

### Charts

The metrics are not saved anywhere, is just UI data collected with a visibility retention of 6 hours, to display over time:

 * Market Fair Value with High and Low Prices
 * Trades Complete
 * Target Position for BTC currency (TBP)
 * Target Position for Fiat currency
 * STDEV and EWMA values for Quote Protection and APR
 * Amount available in wallet for buy
 * Amount held in open trades for buy
 * Amount available in wallet for sell
 * Amount held in open trades for sell
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in BTC currency
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in Fiat currency

### Cloud Hosting

If you ask me, [<img height="20px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/29756933-3e64c62e-8ba8-11e7-916a-3b0ae1481a52.png">](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?475987/cloud/) is a very nice web hosting company (awesome support team, awesome servers). Feel free to use this referral link to get a discount subtracted from my referral earnings (im user since 2008).

### Test units and Build notes

Feel free to run `make test` anytime.

To rebuild the application with your modifications, see `make help` and choose a target.

To pipe the output to stdout, execute the application in the foreground with `./K.sh`.

To ignore the output, execute the application in the background with `screen -dmS K K.sh` or with the alias `make start`.

### Unlock

The bot has all features unlocked, but to support further development by ctubio, the plan soOn is to lock some features.

To unlock all features currently nothing has to be done, but maybe, soOn, a payment of 0.12100000 BTC will be required.

 In case you are looking to extend the trial period, please generate a new API Key in your exchange (each API key have its own trial period). Otherwise if you choose to not support further development by ctubio, just keep running some old commit and do not upgrade.

The current payment is to support further development by ctubio to fix all bugs on the market you are paying against (an alternative [Votes](#votes) system).

To provide exclusivity to proefficient traders and to keep teenagers away, once the bot is bug-free, the payment required may be increased by a minimum of x3.

### Donations

nope, this project doesn't have maintenance costs. but you can donate to your favorite developer today! (or tomorrow!)
